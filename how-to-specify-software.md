Here are some of the main tools to use when specifying software to developers:

-Wireframes
-Comps
-User Stories (As a role, I want a feature, so that benefit)
-Sharing business goals

When specifying, it is important to understand the tradeoff between cost and time.
Communicate what is most important to your developers. 
Fix bid, fix spec doesn’t work unless the project scope is super small. 
Also, don’t be afraid to sit down and have a discussion and hear what the developer says. 
Finally, there is no such thing as perfect code, remain flexible and understand what is good enough.
